this is the command to read php version 5 files into php version 7.
windows command line
extract the downloaded file 
place the file on your local web storage
* example -> laragon -> www -> conversionphp.
open and run the laragon/ xampp command
launch the web browser with the command localhost / conversion file name then enter.
and binggo works.


good luck ^_^.
